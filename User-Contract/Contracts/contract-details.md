## Arcus Swap Contract
### STY3QD0BRHRVFGBKJHSQG2JH1NDZQNDWWR58P8GC.arcus-swapv02

**set-contract-owner**: This function sets the contract owner. It requires the caller (tx-sender) to be the current contract owner to execute successfully.

**provide-liquidity**: This function allows users to provide liquidity to the vault by transferring amount of satosh-tokens to the contract and minting the corresponding amount of arcus-tokens. It ensures that amount is greater than 0, and the caller has enough satosh-tokens to transfer and arcus-tokens are successfully minted.

**withdraw-token**: This function allows a user to withdraw their liquidity by swapping their tokens back. It requires recipient to be the same as the caller (tx-sender) and ensures that amount is greater than 0. It then performs two contract calls: transferring satosh-tokens and transferring arcus-tokens back to the contract owner. It returns ok 1 as a successful response.

From the provided contract, the basic functionality for providing liquidity and withdrawing tokens seems to be present. However, there are some considerations:

- The contract does not handle edge cases like handling situations when the caller is not the contract owner, or the amount to withdraw exceeds the available liquidity.

- There are constants defined for error codes, but there are no explicit error messages provided. Proper error handling is essential to give meaningful feedback to users.

- Security and authorization: The contract should have checks to ensure that only authorized users can call specific functions.

- The contract logic might need further testing and verification to ensure it works as intended.


## Arcus Token Contract & Satosh Token Contract

**Transfer**: This function allows transferring amount of Arcus tokens from the sender to the recipient. It uses the ft-transfer? Clarity function to perform the transfer. Note that the sender must be the contract owner (contract-owner) to execute the transfer.

Get token name, Get token symbol, Get token Decimals, Get token Balance, Get token URI, and Get total supply: These functions are read-only functions that allow querying information about the Arcus-Token. They return the corresponding information as expected.

**Read-only function**: The get-token-balance read-only function retrieves the balance of Arcus tokens for a given wallet (principal). It returns the balance as expected.

**Mint**: The mint-ft function allows minting and transferring Arcus tokens to a specified recipient. It requires the tx-sender to be the contract owner and ensures that amount is greater than 0. It then uses ft-mint? to perform the minting and transfer operation. If successful, it returns ok.

**Transfer-FT**: The transfer-ft function allows transferring Arcus tokens from the contract to a specified recipient. It requires the tx-sender to be the sender and ensures that amount is greater than 0. It then uses ft-transfer? to perform the transfer. If successful, it returns ok.

The provided contract appears to have the necessary functions for a basic fungible token (Arcus-Token) with functionality for transferring tokens, getting token information, and minting new tokens.

However, some considerations for enhancement are as follows:

Error Handling: The contract defines error constants but doesn't provide explicit error messages. Providing meaningful error messages will improve the user experience and help identify issues more easily.

Security and Authorization: The contract currently uses is-eq to check if the tx-sender is the contract owner. Depending on the use case, more robust authorization mechanisms may be needed to ensure secure token operations.

Comprehensive Testing: To ensure that the contract works as expected and handles all edge cases, extensive testing is required. This includes testing different scenarios, edge cases, and potential failure conditions.

URI Support: The contract currently returns none for the token URI. If URI support is intended, further implementation is necessary.
